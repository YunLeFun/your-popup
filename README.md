# WebExtension Vite Starter

A [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) powered WebExtension ([Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/), [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/), etc.) starter template.

## Pre-packed

### WebExtension Libraries

- [`webextension-polyfill`](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) - WebExtension browser API Polyfill with types
- [`webext-bridge`](https://github.com/antfu/webext-bridge) - effortlessly communication between contexts

### Dev tools

- [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) - Streamlined experience for developing web extensions

## Usage

### Folders

- `src` - main source.
  - `contentScript` - scripts and components to be injected as `content_script`
  - `background` - scripts for background.
  - `components` - auto-imported Vue components that are shared in popup and options page.
  - `styles` - styles shared in popup and options page
  - `assets` - assets used in Vue components
  - `manifest.ts` - manifest for the extension.
- `extension` - extension package root.
  - `assets` - static assets (mainly for `manifest.json`).
  - `dist` - built files, also serve stub entry for Vite on development.
- `scripts` - development and bundling helper scripts.

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then **load extension in browser with the `extension/` folder**.

For Firefox developers, you can run the following command instead:

```bash
pnpm start:firefox
```

`web-ext` auto reload the extension when `extension/` files changed.

> While Vite handles HMR automatically in the most of the case, [Extensions Reloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid) is still recommanded for cleaner hard reloading.

### Build

To build the extension, run

```bash
pnpm build
```

And then pack files under `extension`, you can upload `extension.crx` or `extension.xpi` to appropriate extension store.
